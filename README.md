# Guitar Ukelele Tab Converter

## Why Did I Make This?
When learning to play the ukulele, I noticed that ukulele tabs were much less common than guitar tabs. Therefore, to be able to learn more songs, I had to translate guitar tabs to the ukulele mentally, which was a tedious process. To make learning to play more efficient, I decided that it would be beneficial to create a tool which could do this automatically and also save tabs for future use.

## How does the program work?
- The user inputs the tabs for each string on the guitar.
- There is also a button that automatically fills in blanks for strings that are not used.
- The program assigns each note to a number so that it is able to transpose the note correctly on the ukulele.
- It determines how many strings need to be used and which string each note should be played on.
- The ukulele tabs are displayed to the user.
- The user can save these tabs as a .txt file, which can be named by the user.

## Please Note
This program is not fully tested and there may be some minor issues that need to be fixed.
